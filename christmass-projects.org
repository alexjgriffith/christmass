* Possible Projects to Work on With Zoë
** Reverse engineer ESPN app ~ 16 hrs
make use of mitmproxy to find out what their network comunication entails
Use this as a base http://www.shubhro.com/2014/12/18/reverse-engineering-kayak-mitmproxy/
Can be done using python and javascript

** Mock up an on off temperature regulator base microcontroler ~ 10 hrs
Create a bootloader using the arduino
Use the AVR mega or tiny to record temperature and pass out a switch when a temperature passes a certain threshold
Can also implement sd backup for temperature recording throughout the day

** Clean up compression code for ECG signals ~ 30 hrs
Revisit the 5 compression methods used to shrink ECG files
Reimplement the fourier compression method in C (rather than python)
Clean up huffman code creation
Better documentation of code
Create rest or soap api for submitting uncompressed signal for compression and uncompressing compressed code
Implement a series of additional peak detection methods

** Write a controller for a toy mag lev system ~ 40 hrs
create a model of a maglev system and with one input and one output
input:  current to electro magnet
output: Ultrasound signal that can be translated to height of the object
Write a linear controller for the model 1 in analog, 2 in digital
We can assemble a simple mag lev system as well, though ordering the parts may take time

** Implement a massively parallel set of image processing tools ~ 20 hrs
Use OpenCL, MPI or OpenML to implement a map reduce style fourier transform that can be applied to images of various formats.
Also implement a set of complex filters that can be applied to the frequency signal of the data.
Try and support both vector (SVG) and raster (BMP) images
